Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `php-currency-exchange-rate` for local development.

1.  Fork the `php-currency-exchange-rate` repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/php-currency-exchange-rate.git
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5.  When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests, including testing for coding standards:

    ```sh
    vendor/bin/phpunit
    vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix
    ```

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    ```

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
